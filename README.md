# TutorialReport
There are two content files in this repository.
mstutorial1.py contains the code for the Shubham tutorial
mstutorial2.py containts the code for the Pykes tutorial.

Both require the user to have python and the Scikit-Learn library installed. If instructions are needed for installation of Sklearn they are in the beginning of the Shubham tutorial (links to both tutorials are in the references section of the tutorial report). 

mstutorial2.py also implements the pandas dataframe which the user must install. 
Pandas is compatible with python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and can be installed using the command
pip install pandas. *Note: must have a pip version >= 19.3.


With the proper packages installed, both files should run with no further set up. I did not use an ide while writing the files and just ran them in command line so that is probably the best way to run them. 

Both files take no user input, and ouput all of the contents from their respective tutorials. 

*mstutorial1.py runs with a couple of warnings that were not adressed in the tutorial and I did not fix them as they were out of the scope of this tutorial.

**In the data exploration section of mstutorial2.py I commented out a couple of descriptor functions as they take up a lot of space in the final output and they are redundant.
